A new one for me, doing a session in terrain.

Definitely felt like a more muscular session then threshy ints I've previously done, and you could really notice the change in running style/ aggression when needing to push through the forest. Very much appreciated having spender to run with, would have been a grim grim day without him.

With Spendog on the low road heading out of Cockermouth. Odd reps ever so slightly downhill, even reps slightly up but basically flat. A bit icy but the pavement actually turned out to be pretty okay, the only issue was there was a big section of pavement roadworks which forced us onto the road which was actually mega slippy. Realised after a few reps we could just dodge round it tho and get back on the pavement pretty quickly, so not ideal but not too much of an issue.

Anyways legs felt quite alright, and very pleased to find that pace pretty comfy, which is nice considering I haven't dropped sub 3.30s in a few months... I was wearing Saucony endorphin speed, not a carbon plate shoe but the training version, reckon it did help a bit as I only felt strained on the last rep really.

I'm currently about about 3kg over racing weight which is fine for winter season but ideally I'd like to be training at 68-69kg not the big 70kg I am atm. However the past few weeks have been a big training load, more than I've ever done before so I'd rather have too much fuel in the tank than too little. But I can definitely feel the extra weight, especially when doing sessions (this could be a placebo effect tho I'm fairly sure it's not) so I'll try to eat a bit more normally in the coming weeks rather than just literally everything within sight which is what happens atm (again not a bad thing when training hard!)",""

4 courses, each starting with a ~4min climb to the cairn at the top then straight into the full gas downhill course. Pretty savage session tbh, deep in the red by the top (except last rep which we jogged up) each time then had to get the head in gear for some sub 4s downhill O. Dan did a classic 180 off the top on rep 3 which was amusing but also highlighted to me how much less aggressive I orienteered when I wasn't racing someone directly. Something I've worked on a lot this past year but could always still be better.

Rest of the courses were goood tho, on the last one I messed about trying to find a pretty non-existent crag when I was clearly in the circle, should have just done a GG and air-punched it and kept going coz then Dan caught back up so was a grim finish to the rep.

About mid way round I took a hefty tumble which knocked the wind outta me, and I wasn't running as fast after that. However I was catching an SYO man (which I later found out to be Oli Johnson, lol, the long hair threw me) but he was moving very well so the pace ramped back up to get the catch.

Legs felt fine tbh, lacking somewhat in the uphills but not too bad. Area was proper rocky anyways so running speed was more limited by that than the legs. Nav was good.

Back at it!! Had a few foot ouchies when I stood on things on the bit it's bruised, but only a few times and the vast majority was good. Technically was a bit rusty, overshooting the final orange standard control was a personal highlight, and also the terrain speed was not there in the slightest, just couldn't run through any of the crap at any sort of speed, however I'm confident these things will come back pretty quickly!

Big old grind. Right foot has pretty bad plantar fascitis atm and the bruised bone on left foot was a bit aggravated from yesterday so I was swearing a fair amount at those. Nav was good for the majority, went through a bad patch technically at 5,6,7 and then the legs were complaining a lot up to 8. Felt like I was just cruising for a wee while after that, but nav was good. Started to push on again to 17 and held an okay pace to the finish, two gels doing bits in stopping the bonk. All in all never felt like I could race it but I was strong and had mostly good nav, so still up there in results. Annoyingly close to woc spots both days but 3 week ago I couldn't run so I can't complain too much. Looking forward to summer skog :)",""

Such a nice place and the run ended on a hill with a very atmospheric sunset looking onto the Norwegian mountains. Also many rudolfs wandering about, some rather large with some rather large antlers!

Big day of travel setting off at 5.45 finnish time and arriving here at 18.55 swedish Time, but got plenty of naps in so not feeling very tired. Just just got here in time before the supermarket shut which was a big big win as would have had to wait till 9am tomorrow for my next meal otherwise :/ Wanted to do an hour of XT this morning at Arlanda whilst waiting for my train and I'd read you could go to one of the hotel gyms but the guy at reception was having none of it ffs, what a tool bag. Hope to use the gym here or get my hands on  a mountain bike somehow.

On the injury front my left ankle was good for the majority, still sore with any sudden inward movements, right foot completely fine but I'm sure that willstart hurting again soon enough. Right hip got really quite tight as well near the end which was odd. Hey ho, I'd say that was one of the least painful runs of the past few months tbh!",""

- I can't race whilst sore and injured.
- I want to be at the race place 3 days before. 2 day before do ~15mins of otervals on the model. Day before Jog and strides.
- I need to spend more time in terrain so I can move better in it.
- ankles: I will buy a brace/ VJ high tops to train in. Race heavily taped up
- ankles: I will do Bosu work every day
- In terms of training don't do too much running, want to feel comfy, no stressy niggles. Run once a day and XT once a day and S&C once a day. Take a rest day once a week.
- I need at least two camps in relevant terrain, only do this for the big races of the year, EOC/WOC. First one is a week of normal camp, second one should be some races.
- I need to prepare better technically, more geeking and stuff.
- In the race I need a better more consistently aggressive mindset, just go into beast mode for the full thing.

Yea so gooooood to be back racing (first since WOC, madness) Fitness is pretty ropey after the summer of injury + overtraining a few weeks ago (my bad) but ankle held up well today as did my plantar so I could actually focus on the orienteering which was excellent news. Ran really quite okay for the majority, maybe holding back a bit too much on the downhills but technically good, baring one big 1.40min whopper. This was frustrating but it's nice to be frustrated by a mistake rather than not actually being able to run. So yea onwards and upwards :)

Was sitting in 44th before the mistake which would have been A okay, and lost ~1min on the long leg routechoice so much improvements to be had tomorrow :)",""

This is going to be very good practise for those final few races when the legs are dead but you have to perform. I want to win. Technically I want to race hard on the paths and take aggressive lines corner cutting. Then I need a bit of control coming in and off paths. I also don't want to twist the ankle so I will tape it well."

Feeling a bit shit after yesterday, not too full but did properly overdo it on the choccy and sweets. Anyways I ran pre brekky so was feeling somewhat normal by the end lol. We do love a good pfh, can't wait to have Mr Wilson back in action for them.",""

Calf/ achilles gave a little pop on last nights run, probably from standing about all day and starting the run fairly cold. Was pretty okay jogging this morning, no pain but can't be sacked risking it. Good news is I did a similar thing in summer 2019 but way worse and that took ~1week to heal, so probs just on the XT life for the rest of 2021, back on the miles in 2022!",""
